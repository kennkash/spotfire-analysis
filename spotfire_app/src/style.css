Now I understand the issue. The project is using Vite with Tailwind CSS via the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin. When using this plugin, the `@tailwind` directives should be processed by the Vite plugin, but the CSS file is being processed by PostCSS as well.

The warning "Unknown at rule @tailwind" occurs because PostCSS doesn't understand the `@tailwind` directives by default - they need to be processed by the Tailwind CSS plugin. Since we're using the Vite plugin (`@tailwindcss/vite`), the `@tailwind` directives should be processed by Vite, not by PostCSS.

The solution is to either:
1. Remove the `@tailwind` directives from the CSS file since they're being processed by Vite, OR
2. Keep the directives but ensure PostCSS processes them correctly

Looking at the configuration, the Vite plugin is already set up correctly. The issue is that the CSS file is being processed by PostCSS which doesn't understand the `@tailwind` directives.

The best solution is to remove the `@tailwind` directives from the CSS file since Vite's Tailwind plugin will handle the processing automatically when the CSS is imported.
